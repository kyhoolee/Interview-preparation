## Coding preparation 
### Target 
* Coding prepration 
* Two type of interview
  - Coding on online-editor like hackerrank
  - Human-interview: receive problem - explain idea - coding on online text-editor (No coding support)
* Require
  - Understanding and able to demonstrate the algorithm step-by-step
  - Quick solving problem: realize situation - quick solution idea - quick improving idea - evaluate quality of solution

### Detail 
* Finish review famous algorithm: 
  - from basic sorting to basic graph algorithm
  - No need to review hard-algorithms
  - Link: [Algorithm](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/tutorial/)
* Practice:
  - Focus on Easy and Medium problem
  - No need to solving hard-problem
